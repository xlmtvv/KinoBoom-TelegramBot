# KinoBoom-TelegramBot

This is my pet-project related to telegram bots

I used the aiogram library as the main one to create a telegram bot.
To get information about the ratings of movies, TV shows, etc., I used the TMDB api and parsed the data from there.
I used the Bs4 library and requests to get the rating of movies from the movie search.

Also in the code, datetime libraries were used to get the date and parse movies that will be released soon; the time library for the sleep function; tmdbv3api library for simplified use of the TMDB API.

The data for the ratings was taken from these resources:
1)https://www.kinopoisk.ru/
2)https://www.themoviedb.org/
