# KinoBoom-TelegramBot
WARNING!!! THE BOT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK CORRECTLY

This is my pet-project related to telegram bots.
This bot is associated with the theme of films and series.

I used the aiogram library as the main one to create a telegram bot.
To get information about the ratings of movies, TV shows, etc., I used the TMDB api and parsed the data from there.
I used the Bs4 library and requests to get the rating of movies from the movie search.

Also in the code, datetime libraries were used to get the date and parse movies that will be released soon; the time library for the sleep function; tmdbv3api library for simplified use of the TMDB API.

The data for the ratings was taken from these resources:
1)https://www.kinopoisk.ru/
2)https://www.themoviedb.org/


Run the main file to start the bot
Thank you for your attention, good luck
